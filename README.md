# BoardBrain
Tired of game nights turning into rulebook marathons? 🎲

I developed a Generative AI assistant using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to extract and answer user queries from complex board game rulebooks (like Catan or Monopoly), leveraging Gemini 1.5 Pro for prompt-based reasoning and semantic embeddings to deliver context-aware responses. 

💡 Beyond Board Games?\
This framework can easily be adapted for: \
📚 Academic textbooks\
⚖️ Legal & policy assistants\
🏥 Medical guideline summarizers\
🔧 DIY/ User Manual Support bots\

**Anywhere there’s a long document and a user with questions, this approach fits in!**
