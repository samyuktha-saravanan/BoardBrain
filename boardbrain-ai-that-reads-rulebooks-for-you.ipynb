Players simply upload the rulebook of a game in PDF format, and BoardBrain transforms it into an intelligent Q&A experience using Gemini 1.5 Pro. From Settlers of Catan to Monopoly, complex rules are no longer a barrier to fun!\n\n## 🚀 Features\n- 📄 Upload and parse PDF rulebooks\n- 🔍 Automatically chunk and embed rule text\n- 🧠 Retrieve the most relevant rule sections using FAISS\n- 🤖 Answer natural language questions with Gemini 1.5 Pro\n\n> Example: *\"Can I trade brick for wood in Catan?\"*\n\n## 🧠 Gen AI Capabilities Demonstrated\n\n| Capability                        | Applied in BoardBrain |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------|\n| ✅ Document Understanding         | Extracts and chunks rulebook content from PDFs |\n| ✅ Embeddings     | Uses Gemini Embedding API  |\n| ✅ Vector Search | FAISS for retrieval |\n| ✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) | Combines context with Gemini 1.5 Pro to generate answers |\n\n## 💡 Real-World Problem Solved\nMany board games have lengthy, complex rulebooks that discourage casual players.
